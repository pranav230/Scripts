## Organizing files in tutorials ##

If you are watching some tutorials for something then you need to organize the stuff in your folders because all the content of the folder looks very messy as it contains all the zip files, PDFs etc.

To organize the files in that folder, you can just run this bash script which will organize the content of the folder for you.

Copy this script file to the folder which you want to organize and just run this command in the terminal :
```
sudo ./organize.sh
```
